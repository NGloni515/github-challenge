## Getting Started

First, install the packages with:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes] can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api).

## Tests

As an extra I created some basic tests:

```bash
# to run frontend tests
npm run test-front
# to run backend tests
npm run test-back
```
