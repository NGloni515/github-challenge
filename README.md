## Getting Started

First, install the packages with:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, update the Github key GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY in the .env file with the one shared in the email

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tests

As an extra I created some basic tests (don't forget to stop the server before running the tests):

```bash
# to run frontend tests
npm run test-front
# to run backend tests
npm run test-back
```
